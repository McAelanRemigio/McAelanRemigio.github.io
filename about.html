      <h1>About</h1>

      <p class="lede">
        I am a junior at San Diego State University majoring in Statistics with an emphasis in Data Science and minoring in Leadership Development. 
        I founded and co-founded multiple student organizations focused on technology leadership, including SDSU’s very first data science organization, 
        the Data Science Initiative. Through this work, I helped establish the initial data science community on campus and mentored students into 
        internships in data science and analytics. For this leadership and service, I was selected as the 2025 Daniel B. Nowak Outstanding Student 
        Service Award recipient, the sole undergraduate nominee among 41,000+ students at SDSU.
      </p>

      <p class="lede">
        I am a Data Analyst at SDSU Career Services, where I build analytics systems that shape institutional decision-making at scale. 
        I led labor market analysis across four California State University campuses to support a statewide workforce development proposal, 
        contributing to a successful $2M grant award.
      </p>

      <p class="lede">
        Across research and public-sector environments, I operate at the intersection of analytics, strategy, and execution. 
        At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, I led analytics efforts that translated complex, 
        high-volume data into decision frameworks used to guide classification strategy, staffing, and long-term planning, shifting work from analysis 
        as output to analysis as leverage.
