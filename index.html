    <p><strong>Data Scientist â€¢ Vera C. Rubin Observatory Intern â€¢ Student Leader</strong></p>

    <section>
      <p>Iâ€™m a third-year undergraduate at San Diego State University pursuing a B.S. in Statistics: Data Science, with minors in Applied Mathematics and Leadership Development.</p>
      <p>Iâ€™ve worked with the CDC, the SDSU Research Foundation, and currently hold roles at:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Vera C. Rubin Observatory:</strong> Machine learning classification of variable stars</li>
        <li><strong>SDSU Student Life & Leadership:</strong> Event programming and analytics</li>
        <li><strong>SDSU Career Services:</strong> Engagement metric dashboards and reporting</li>
      </ul>

          <strong><a href="https://github.com/McAelanRemigio/VeraRubin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rubin Variable Star Classifier</a></strong><br />
          Classified RR Lyrae, Miras, LPVs, and Cepheids and mapped them in 3D using simulated LSST data from the Vera Rubin Observatory.  
          Built Python pipelines on the TAP Service to query astronomical catalogs in ADQL and Astropy, engineered variability features, applied PCA, and modeled Period-Luminosity relations for distance estimation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><a href="https://github.com/McAelanRemigio/ATUS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ATUS Causal Inference Study</a></strong><br />
          Discovered that remote work led to a 0.7-hour/day increase in leisure time across U.S. households post-pandemic.  
          Analyzed 10,000+ American Time Use Survey records using difference-in-differences (DiD) modeling in R with Tidyverse, dplyr, readr, and stringr.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><a href="https://github.com/McAelanRemigio/MPIE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MPIE HSI Impact Evaluation</a></strong><br />
          Identified a 60% increase in student success rates after implementing professional development programs across Hispanic-Serving Institutions.  
          Utilized R, SQL, and regression modeling to analyze outcomes of 10,000+ HSI students and co-designed a 2-year PD program for math educators.
