    <p><strong>Data Scientist â€¢ Vera C. Rubin Observatory Intern â€¢ Student Leader</strong></p>

    <section>
      <p>Iâ€™m a third-year undergraduate at San Diego State University pursuing a B.S. in Statistics: Data Science, with minors in Applied Mathematics and Leadership Development.</p>
      <p>Iâ€™ve worked with the CDC, the SDSU Research Foundation, and currently hold roles at:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Vera C. Rubin Observatory:</strong> Machine learning classification of variable stars</li>
        <li><strong>SDSU Student Life & Leadership:</strong> Event programming and analytics</li>
        <li><strong>SDSU Career Services:</strong> Engagement metric dashboards and reporting</li>
      </ul>

          <strong><a href="https://github.com/McAelanRemigio/VeraRubin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rubin Variable Star Classifier</a></strong><br />
          Build Python pipelines and query astronomical catalogs in ADQL and Astropy for ML classification of variable stars (RR Lyrae, Miras, LPVs, Cepheids) using real and simulated LSST data. Engineer variability features, perform PCA, and apply Period-Luminosity relations for stellar distance estimation and 3D mapping.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><a href="https://github.com/McAelanRemigio/ATUS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ATUS Causal Inference Study</a></strong><br />
          Analyzed 10,000+ American Time Use Survey records to estimate a 0.7-hour/day increase in leisure time due to remote work using DiD modeling in R. Applied causal inference to study post-pandemic behavioral shifts using Tidyverse.

      <summary><h2>ðŸŒŸ Why I Do This</h2></summary>
      <p>
        I didnâ€™t grow up wanting to be a data scientist. When I was choosing a major, it came down to business or data science and honestly, I just picked what sounded more interesting at the time. It felt random, but I went with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking back, that choice changed everything. I realized I love making sense of things most people overlook. Turning complex problems into something clear and useful, it just clicked for me. Data science became more than my major; it became the way I want to build, lead, and create impact no matter where I go.
